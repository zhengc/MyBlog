    Bug Description: Failed to convert value of type 'java.lang.String' to required type 'java.lang.Integer';
                     nested exception is java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "css"
    Fix: I had a controller that accepts two parameters. One is of type String, the other is of type Integer.
         So, when I tried to let Thymeleaf load my css files, that controller somehow caught the css import
         route, leading to the mentioned error. Removing that controller solved the issue.
