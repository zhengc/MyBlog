    Bug Description: Failed to convert value of type 'java.lang.String' to required type 'java.lang.Integer';
                     nested exception is java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "css"

    Fix: I had a controller that accepts two parameters. One is of type String, the other is of type Integer.
         So, when I tried to let Thymeleaf load my css files, that controller somehow caught the css import
         route, leading to the mentioned error. Removing that controller solved the issue.

    Bug Description: org.thymeleaf.exceptions.TemplateInputException: An error happened during template parsing
                    (template: "class path resource [templates/admin/adminIndex.html]")

    Fix: When I needed to apply Thymeleaf template, I should insert the full relative path of the template. In
         this case for example, the adminIndex.html uses the admin_fragment.html template, then I need to use the
         full relative path: admin/admin_fragment.

    Bug Description: th:text does not work
    Fix: This is because I did not create the entity object correct, so the returned object has null name. That is why
         I did not see the replaced text. I added @RequestParam to the respective controller method, and called the
         object constructor correctly. It works fine now.

    Bug Description: When I tried to remove a category from the database (i.e. deleteById), it returned a 404 error.
    Fix: I made myself awkward again. It turned out that I missed a "/" at the very beginning of the th:href link.
