                                        You break down my walls with the strength of your love, mm

                                        Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
                                        Just all that you are and everything that you do

                                        [Pre-Chorus]
                                        I don't really need to look very much further
                                        I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
                                        I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
                                        Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide

                                        [Chorus]
                                        But don't make me close one more door
                                        I don't wanna hurt anymore
                                        Stay in my arms if you dare
                                        Or must I imagine you there
                                        Don't walk away from me
                                        I have nothing, nothing, nothing
                                        If I don't have you, you, you, you, you

                                        [Verse 2]
                                        You see through, right to the heart of me
                                        You break down my walls with the strength of your love, mm

                <p>
                    I am a senior standing student majoring in Computer Science at University of Washington, Seattle.
                    I am passionate about applying new technologies that I learned to build interesting projects.
                    I like working out, running, and playing video games, especially those on Nintendo Switch.
                    I traveled a lot in the past during vacations, but now that we are still in the pandemic, I could
                    only visit places nearby.
